    <h2>Education</h2>

    <hr>

    <h3>Stockholm University</h3>
    <h4>Bachelor's Degree in Computer and System Sciences</h4>
    <p>2008 - 2011</p>
    <p>
      An education that has given me a broad foundation to stand on, while I also had the chance to focus on what interests me the most. The bachelor programme included courses in subjects such as systems analysis, system development, human-computer interaction, database methodology and computer security. I primarily selected courses in system development, because that was something I found to be be very fun, interesting and challenging. Java was my primary language, but I also took courses in programming for the web with languages such as XHTML, CSS, PHP and JavaScript.

    <h3>Domarhagsskolan</h3>
    <h4>Upper Secondary School, Media programme - Graphic communication</h4>
    <p>2003 - 2006</p>
    <p>
An education where I learned how to design both printed materials and publications for the web using programs such as QuarkXpress, InDesign, Photoshop, Illustrator and Dreamweaver. I also took courses in subjects such as photography, film and web design. I spent my 15 weeks of workplace training at the web agency Jamtport IT konsult AB. There I worked both in larger projects together with a team, as well as on my own in smaller projects where I designed web pages for individual customers.
